1. deep learning-based solutions **lack mathematical elegance** and offer **very little interpretability** of the found solution or understanding of the underlying phenomena

2. certain deep learning-based contributions bear some elegance that cannot be dismissed. Such is the case with the **style-transfer problem**, which yielded amazingly beautiful results, and with inversion ideas of learned networks used to synthesize images out of thin air
